# Multi-stage build: deps are installed in a UBI builder (has pip), then copied into the
# distroless Red Hat Hardened Image (Project Hummingbird) runtime, which has no shell or
# package manager and runs as non-root UID 65532.
#
# Dependencies are installed with `pip --target` and run via `python -m` so nothing depends
# on console-script shebangs or the interpreter path. Both stages are Python 3.12 so wheels
# (e.g. PyYAML's) are ABI-compatible.
#
# NOTE: confirm the runtime image tag and that `python` resolves on PATH against the catalog
# (https://catalog.redhat.com, `hi/` namespace). Pin by digest for reproducible builds.
